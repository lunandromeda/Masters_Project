      "therapy is optional. while parents need to consent to therapy for their child typically, there is an exception in cases where doing so would cause harm to the minor, in some states. that's for when a child is seeking therapy. but in this case where you don't want therapy, you can decline treatment and the therapist should respect that. they may continue to try to meet and provide services, but you can choose to not participate and they cannot force you, at least not in my state. you should look up the consent forms you signed when therapy started or ask to see them. you can also look up consent laws for mental health treatment in your state. but if your state is like mine or even if not, you can say, i do not consent to treatment and do not feel this form of therapy is in my best interests. they can't force you to physically or verbally participate. if you've told your mom you don't want to do this and it's being forced on you anyways, you are well within your rights as a human being to not participate.",
      "all the psychologists i've worked with are like that. i believe it is also considered best practice. you pay for an assessment so you're just looking for them to give an explaination for your symptoms based on different tests and observations. some might say my specialty is diagnosing autism and i don't think what you're experiencing is autism. but if they can't give you an answer to what they think it is, they should then say, i'll point you in the direction of someone who is more experienced in either a specific field that they think your symptoms may be related to or someone more senior than them who can determine what the diagnosis is. for example, my husband went to the psychiatrist after a mental health crisis. they diagnosed him with major depressive disorder and adhd, however, they said there were other symptoms that were not covered by those diagnosis' and that in their opinion it is likely asd. however, they were not experienced with diagnosing asd, more mental health and medical conditions, so he was referred and put on a waitlist for a provider who will confirm his asd.",
      "so adhd meds can make autistic burnout worse adhd meds can just make a lot of things worse when you‚Äôre also autistic. try seeing if you can access ssris, they can definitely improve autistic burnout, however they can also make the restlessness side of adhd a lot worse (i take vyvanse and fluoxetine and it‚Äôs quite good but on the days i take a lower dose/no dose of vyvanse the fluoxetine just makes me very restless and either takes away my motivation or my executive functions) it really depends on whether your adhd or asd is more ‚Äòprominent‚Äô aka which one you suffer more from. i was diagnosed with asd when i was 7 but stereotypes and being afab and it also being 2012 and then i was diagnosed with adhd in 2021, i didn‚Äôt start taking ssri‚Äôs until start of this year and they helped a lot with the autistic burnout, they also numbed a lot of the sensitivities i have. you do have to be careful about the emotional numbing of them, because while you might not feel some of it your body may still be affected by the emotions, so lots of self reflection and check ins are needed. also if you have anxiety and/or depression in the case of an autistic person the therapy treatment doesn‚Äôt always work because it‚Äôs usually about changing mindset and a lot of the anxiety and depression autists experience isn‚Äôt about mindset (it can be but a lot of the time it‚Äôs not) i figured out my anxiety was ingrained, it‚Äôs never going to be able to be fixed by a change of mindset because i know the logic and everything behind the anxiety and the situations blah blah but it‚Äôs still there, it‚Äôs part of my experience as being autistic so yeah a contributor to burnout."

      "honestly i‚Äôm never going to get an official autism diagnosis because there‚Äôs no benefit of getting one. i‚Äôve heard a lot of stories from others about how invalidated they felt or how mistreated they were while trying to get a diagnosis. and i personally don‚Äôt need someone who‚Äôs most likely not autistic tell me whether they think i exhibit autistic symptoms. because that‚Äôs really all they‚Äôd be doing is saying ‚Äúyeah that sounds right‚Äù or ‚Äúno that doesn‚Äôt‚Äù. and it might just be that i have a pda profile but i know myself better than they do and if they say i don‚Äôt have autism, then they‚Äôd be just plain wrong. but besides my personal reasons for not wanting one, i just don‚Äôt see a benefit anywhere else. if it‚Äôs on my record, i‚Äôd just be worried that someone would find out or that it would prevent me from doing something i want to do in the future. i want to be in control of who knows about my autism.",
      "therapist said i don‚Äôt need a diagnosis because im high functioning basically i‚Äôm trying to get medicated for my adhd and i met with a therapist who specializes in adhd and autism and i told her all about my symptoms etc and how i have family members who have adhd autism or both and how i have suspected i have autism too and long story short she said that if i am autistic that i would be very high functioning and don‚Äôt need a diagnosis because i wouldn‚Äôt have any benefit from one because i‚Äôm also getting help for my adhd symptoms and that typically there isn‚Äôt really anything you can do for high functioning autism which i think is understandable because the goal is to get help. but then she said something else that confused me she said im either a high function autistic along with having adhd or.. im an extremely introverted person who has adhd. and i understand why i wouldn‚Äôt benefit from an official diagnosis but this only makes me wonder more because i know the symptoms i have and what i‚Äôm dealing with and it definitely exceeds being shy and introverted but i also feel so unsure of myself like i have imposter syndrome and i feel like unless a professional gives me a direct answer i will just forever be unsure. i know that it‚Äôs likely for adhd and autism symptoms to overlap and both disorders run in my family. i feel how i felt before getting my adhd diagnosis the uncertainty of knowing but being so unsure of myself even though i was right the whole time."

      "how old were you when you did aba? how long did you do it?. usually, the answer is that the op didn't do aba and has no direct experience. if that's the case, i then usually say we should be listening to people who have experienced aba and autistic people who work in aba. if i am feeling like arguing, i will also add that lsn autistic people without experience in aba speak over msn and hsn autistic people who have experienced aba. if op did experience aba and is traumatized, i simply say that i am so sorry that happened, and it isn't okay. i will never tell someone they don't feel the way they feel or their lived experiences were wrong. i then usually thank them for advocating for the next generation of autistic children. however, the old aba still exists and without the anti-aba crowd being so vocal, i wouldn't have known. i am grateful to them for that.",
      "so it really depends on the therapist, because when aba therapy was first introduced it was focused on a lot of wrong things and had bad practices. more recently, aba therapy has become a lot better then it used to be, but if you don‚Äôt like your therapist it‚Äôs okay to switch. aba focuses a lot on teaching neurodivergent people life skills like how to socialize without coming across as offensive, or how to cope in certain situations. i worked in a school setting that helped pre-k students, and it was definitely beneficial for them, though depending on your age it could look very different. if this sounds like something you would like help with, then i recommend it. if you do go along with it, make sure to communicate your needs to your therapist, and maybe share some of your stims with them if you are comfortable doing so. if i wasn‚Äôt very clear about something or you have another question you can ask me and i will respond when i see it.",
      "so, couple of things that might be worth pointing out here - first, aba practitioners often make an effort to make aba enjoyable - they may fail miserably, but the rewards often associated with correct behaviors have to have some value to the kid in order to be effective, so in an extremely limited context, they're making the kid happy. associating rewards with good behaviors is actually one of the major problems with aba (mainly in that it's over-applied), because it teaches the kid that if they just do everything everyone ever asks them to, they'll get rewarded for it - while this might seem like a selling point at first, long-term, it has the potential to cause a lot of harm, because outside of the carefully controlled environment of the therapy sessions, and especially as the kid gets older, it creates a dependence on other people telling them what to do - and those people may not always be competent or have the kid's (and future adult's) best interests at heart. your comparison to what your mother did for/to you in high school is also a little off, for a couple of reasons - first, you were in high school - at least 12 years older than your kid is now, with a substantially more developed and less impressionable brain - one that had a harder time internalizing the message that there's something wrong with you (which is implied by any externally forced change), and could see a little more nuance to the situation - that doesn't make it a good thing to force kids in that situation into a specific activity, but some activity can be very beneficial. that kind of brings me to the second point - at the time your mother engaged in behavior modification to try to fix your problems, you had problems. some action would probably have benefitted you, and your mom acted."

      "i‚Äôve been in therapy for about 6 years, and it has helped me so much. a big piece of it is finding the right therapist, and it might take a few tries to find someone you feel really comfortable with. a therapist is there to help you. if you sorta know what you‚Äôre struggling with, they should be able to help you, even if you don‚Äôt have any ‚Äútherapy goals‚Äù going in. i‚Äôve had a couple therapists, and i normally tell them that i have really bad anxiety, and that‚Äôs a starting point. i‚Äôm also not good at just talking. i need it to be more directed, so i‚Äôll tell my therapist that and then it‚Äôll be more question and answer formatted than an open conversation. the first step is going. it‚Äôs ok if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre looking for because you‚Äôre looking for help. as long as you can be patient with the process, a good therapist will help you figure out what you need. that being said, if you find that you‚Äôre not comfortable with someone after 3 sessions, switch therapists. it takes some trial and error sometimes to find the right therapist.",
      "if your therapist makes you feel misunderstood about something that is a huge part of your world and how you navigate and communicate that's a problem. if you have a good therapist that fits well with you then it should not be hard for them to understand things they aren't experienced in. for example my therapist is not specialized in religious trauma she was able to help me overcome a lot of my shit regardless because we problem solve together well. i feel that she has my back and that she believes me. you can always bring these issues up with your therapist too. i know it seems awkward but if you can't be honest with your therapist then why are you in therapy, you know? one of the benefits of therapy is learning to have these uncomfortable conversations to begin with. so if you can't find a new therapist bringing this up with your therapist is a good thing to try. and maybe talk therapy wont work for you. and that's ok."

      "i use neurodivergent when referring to all conditions (not just adhd and autism), but i like using that label for myself too because i am not only audhd but have other conditions that fall under that umbrella and make my experience different (doesn‚Äôt make having them easier or harder than other people, just a different experience) than others who only have one condition or a different collection within that umbrella than i do. i also like neurodivergent because i can use it to not only talk about my experiences but also be able to explain to people without divulging more than i am comfortable with about my conditions (unfortunately people are jerks when it comes to specific conditions, or they are clueless about the differing presentations of a specific condition in a wide range of people). i don‚Äôt like telling new people right away, unless i know it‚Äôs safe, and i have not outed myself as having my specific conditions at work, but neurodivergent does suffice as a way to explain myself and anything that comes up as needed with new people. people have gotten to know me at work and i‚Äôve had no issues, but they do understand there are certain things about me that are just me (examples being i like lists or notes written, like having mine and my close coworkers‚Äô schedules for reference, hate stopping in the middle of something without a good reason, as well as some other stuff that does not impede work, but can definitely set me apart from others if comparing me to others).",

      "i was (mis)diagnosed with bpd when i was 20, then adhd and autism at 31. i honestly think bpd is just a bunch of nd symptoms they didn't realise were part of neurodivergence. why do so many women get diagnosed with bpd in their early 20s and almost no men? i think it's because our nd symptoms are different and tend to be more in the emotional side which then fits bpd. it was called borderline pd because they couldn't make up their minds whether it was neurological or psychological (neurosis or psychosis). i really related to a lot of bpd symptoms when i was younger, but when i looked into audhd there was nothing that couldn't have been just been me silently battling those 2 conditions my entire life - right down to the self harm bit and the fact i was diagnosed with depression at the ripe old age of 12."

      "a diagnosis isn‚Äôt something to joke about. it‚Äôs a sigh of relief for everyone involved, most of all you. when i discussed the possibility of having autism to my husband, he was a little immature at first. he did make it about himself in some ways i wasn‚Äôt okay with. somewhat dismissive. very boomer-ish (lol). however, it only took about an hour for him to process and understand it. now it is extremely helpful to us in understanding my behavior/special needs. he loves me for who i am and supports my autism as much as he can. he never insulted me, nor did he imply that there is something wrong with me. the way your husband is dealing with it is very selfish and childish. sometimes, my husband has childish knee-jerk reactions (trust me it pisses me off but we all have flaws) however he knows this and corrects it immediately without being told. to not acknowledge what he said was wrong would be a huge deal breaker for me. this is a big trust and miscommunication issue. you know him better than us but just know that what he said was not ok.",
      "as your husband, this shouldn't be any surprise to him and certainly not a bad surprise (there is absolutely no way to explain away his reaction - that joke is not ambiguous there - he's reacting poorly and then gaslighting your accurate awareness of this.) he should have been involved and knowing how you felt about the journey to reach this diagnosis, and be happy with it- because you're happy. it's shocking his reaction wasn't supportive but was instead surprise and discomfort. if he knew you were going to go for testing, perhaps he didn't believe you were autistic and was hoping for a different result. he is allowed to feel how he feels, he's just human not superman, but if he can't overcome bad feelings and perceptions of autistic people, he's just not going to be a compatible partner for you."

      "just curious; what do you get out of the relationship? there must be something other than attraction, desire, and sex that is keeping you with your husband. he's given you a way to have those things in your life, but you continue to seek them from him, even though he's made it clear that he's not interested in meeting your needs. really the discussion to have is whether or not your open relationship arrangement is meeting your needs, and based on your post here, it seems like it isn't. he doesn't seem likely to change to meet your needs, and you don't seem to be getting those missing things from your other partners. these are not adhd issues, you have a sexual compatibility problem. your therapist should be focused on that, not your husband's neurodivergance. have you discussed hl/ll, asexuality, any issues that speak directly to the issue at hand with the therapist? or has the whole conversation been about adhd? probably time for a new therapist either way."

      "ketamine is a medication that inhibits a receptor in the brain and spinal cord called nmda. at high doses ketamine can use is an anesthetic medication used to put people to sleep for surgery; however, at lower doses it can be used for the treatment of both chronic and acute pain as well as depression. at lower doses most people do not go to sleep or experience immediate memory impairment on ketamine. at lower doses ketamine creates a psychedelic effect that allows for new connections to be made in the brain at an accelerated pace. it essentially reroutes the brains normal connections to form a new ones which helps alleviate symptoms of depression, trauma, and chronic pain because the brain is now creating new pathways to function.",

      "what every autistic person going through burnout needs to hear! i recently quit going to therapy after about 6 years because it was absolutely useless and making me feel worse. then i started going to an autistic life coach and already i am feeling like this is helping me more than all of those years of therapy did. he told me exactly what every autistic person that is going through burnout needs to hear... i want to take a moment to acknowledge how deeply this has impacted you and assure you that you are not alone in what you‚Äôre experiencing. autistic burnout, as you‚Äôve described, is not just physical or emotional exhaustion - it‚Äôs a profound shutdown of your ability to function.",
      "i'm generally at a low level of burnout, sometimes higher, but i work very hard to make sure i don't get to full burnout level because i'm worried about this exact scenario. i need to be independent, and while i'm not at risk of losing my employment necessarily, the short-term disability pay is less than my salary and i don't really want to have to deal with reduced income when i'm already super stressed. i'm working on increasing my savings so if that should happen, i won't be as worried. realistically, having only recently found out i was autistic as well, i'm probably heading straight towards a massive burnout down the line. but i'll do everything i can to keep that from happening. i've been rearranging my life in the last few months to ensure it won't happen; i'm leaving heavily on friends for help if i need it. my family lives far away but i can't really rely on them anyway because they have a bunch of opinions of what i should do and most of it is crap."

      "idk if it's age or what, but each time i've tried to really push for that pure 100% effort it's been sustained for shorter and shorter times. first time i did it i lasted about a year (college). second time lasted about a semester (grad school). at that point i burned out so hard i felt the effects for years. since then i haven't really been able to sustain a hard pace for more than a few weeks, maybe a month. there was also a lot going on throughout the 15-year span of this burnout experiment, but something i noticed is that burnout typically corresponded to issues surrounding my social life. even though i can't sustain serious effort for too long, i tend to last longer if my social life is in decent shape. it's hard to control specific factors, so in general i work hard and be efficient when i can and otherwise try to take it easy and ignore the guilt of being unproductive. it's worked out well enough."
